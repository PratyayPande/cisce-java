## A minimalist Java code repository for CISCE students
This is a code storage repository for students looking forward to coding in Java for as part of the school curriculum/activities. Created and maintained by students who have graduated from school, this repository houses some programs that former students have written in class and examinations. The objective of this repository is to maintain a warehouse of programs for students to learn and practice.

All code in this repository is free and is available for further contributions from everyone.

You need to have git preinstalled on your computer. You can verify the git installation by opening a terminal/command prompt and executing: 
`git --version`

If you have git installed, the version details will be displayed. Then you can skip to the configuration section.
