## A minimalist Java code repository for CISCE students
This is a code storage repository for students looking forward to coding in Java for as part of the school curriculum/activities. Created and maintained by students who have graduated from school, there are some programs that former students have written in class and in their examinations. The objective of this repository is just to maintain a warehouse of programs for students to learn and practice.
