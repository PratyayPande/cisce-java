# Problem statements:

## Problem statement 1: Infix to Postfix conversion

Create a Java program to accept an infix expression and convert it to postfix. Assume that the operands are single digit numerals and the expression input is without braces. Feel free to use as many classes and constructors as you like.

**Solution Files:** InfixApp.java and InfixAppToPost.java

Main method: 'void main()' from InfixApp.java

Concepts used:
1. loops
2. Classes and objects
3. Data structures: stack
4. Inheritance
5. Constructors

## Problem Statement 2: 

You are given an array of integers of length n and an integer m. Calculate the number of m-countdowns in the array.

**m-countdowns:** a set of numbers is said to be am m-countdown when it contains the numbers {m, m-1, m-2, ... 3, 2, 1} in this specific order (decreasing order).

#### Sample I/O:

**INPUT:** 
12 3

1 2 3 7 9 3 2 1 8 3 2 1

**OUTPUT:** 2

**EXPLANATION:** n = 12, m = 3

1, 2, 3, 7, 9, *3, 2, 1*, 8, *3, 2, 1*

There are 2 sub-arrays where the numbers {3, 2, 1} are present in that order.

**Solution files:** mCountdowns.java

Concepts used:
1. Loops
2. Algorithms

## Problem Statement 3:

Accept a string and check if the string contains unique characters. Try to do the same without using any data structures.

Concepts used:
1. Loops/nested loops
2. Algorithms

**Solution file:** CheckUnique.java

## Problem Statement 4:

Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer.

NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine. An extra copy of the array is not.

**Solution file:** RemDup.java

Concepts used:
1. Algorithms
2. String Handling
3. Loops

## Problem Statement 5:

Imagine you have a robot that can move only right and down in a 2D-grid. You have to find the number of possible ways to do this.
