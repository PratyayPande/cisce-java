# A simple spaghetti code to demonstrate the functions of a binary tree

Hi there!! This is just some bit of rough code to implement and demonstrate how a binary tree works. It is not designed well yet and currently consists of only the command line interface, but we have plans to make it more awesome than it is now.

### Basic Instructions

* You can start by running main() in BinTreeApp.java or by running `javac BinTreeApp.java` and `java BinTreeApp` on the terminal. The commands that you need to use the CLI are as follows:

## Functions:

### Inserting a node

#### Insertion of the root node:

Insertion of the root node is the first thing you should do after you start the program. Insert the root node by typing in the terminal:
```
insert root <INTEGER>
```
It creates the root node and initialises the binary tree.

#### Insertion of any node

### Navigating through the nodes

You can navigate through the nodes in the tree the same way you navigate through the filesystem in Command Prompt or Terminal. Here are some basic ways you can do it:

`cd r` **:** navigates to the node on the right of the current node.

`cd l` **:** navigates to the node on the left of the current node.

`cd root` or `cd home`**:** navigates to the root of the tree
