# Binary Tree User Instructions

## Introduction

In the current existing version of the program, we only have the CLI implementation of the binary tree. There are plans for making a proper UI to implement the code in the future and we will be really happy if anyone is willing to collaborate.

The following manual covers the sections of how to insert nodes into the tree and display the tree contents. Still in the making, we have tried to explain as much as we can on how to use the CLI.

## Functions:

### Inserting a node

#### Insertion of the root node:

Insertion of the root node is the first thing you should do after you start the program. Insert the root node by typing in the terminal:
```
insert root <INTEGER>
```
It creates the root node and initialises the binary tree.

#### Insertion of any node

### Navigating through the nodes

You can navigate through the nodes in the tree the same way you navigate through the filesystem in Command Prompt or Terminal. Here are some basic ways you can do it:

`cd r`**:** navigates to the node on the right of the current node.

`cd l`**:** navigates to the node on the left of the current node.

`cd root` or `cd home`**:** navigates to the root of the tree
